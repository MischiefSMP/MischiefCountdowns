# MischiefCountdowns

MischiefCountdowns allows you to create multiple countdowns that can be displayed both via a boss bar and in chat (disabled by default).

![Demo](https://i.imgur.com/VkvgwWi.png)

Command Usage:
```/countdown [start/stop] <id> <seconds> [pink/blue/red/green/yellow/purple/white]```

Commands exist with a unique id. This id can contain Colors (which are only displayed).

So the id ```&6Morning&4Meeting``` becomes ```morningmeeting``` in practice.

This is only important should you want to stop a countdown.

The config.yml allows you to change multiple settings like default bar color, if its shown at all etc.

Note: 
Should you get an error while updating to a newer version please try to delete the Plugin folder "MischiefCountdowns" and restart.

## PlaceholderAPI

MischiefCountdowns adds two placeholders:

%mischiefcountdowns_id_<id>% -> Translates into the formatted id, so with color and upper/lowercase letters

%mischiefcountdowns_number_<id>% -> Translates into the actual countdown as an Integer
